		<p>If $\sum$ is the solid boundary of a large spherical surface of radius $R$, containing fluid in motion and also enclosing one or more closed surfaces, then the mean value of $\varphi$ on $\sum$ is of the form $\bar{\phi} = \dfrac{M}{R}+C$, where $M$, $C$ are constants. provided that the fluid extends to infinity and is at rest there.</p>
