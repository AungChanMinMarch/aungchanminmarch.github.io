	<h2>Power Series</h2>
	<p>In this section, we shall derive some properties of functions which are represented by power series, i.e. functions of the form 
		$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n \tag{1}$$
	or more generally
		$$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n (x-a)^n$$
	These are called analytic functions.</p>
	<p>We shall restrict ourselves to real values of $x$. Instead of circles of convergence (see {% a 3.39 %}) we shall therefore encounter intervals of convergence.</p>
	If (1) converges for all $x$ in $(-R,R)$, for some $R>0$ ($R$ may be $+\infty$), we say that $f$ is expanded in a power series avout the point $x=0$. Similarly, if (2) converges for $\abs{x-a} < R$, $f$ is said to be expanded in a power series about the point $x=a$. As a matter of convenience, we shall often take $a=0$ without any loss of generality.
