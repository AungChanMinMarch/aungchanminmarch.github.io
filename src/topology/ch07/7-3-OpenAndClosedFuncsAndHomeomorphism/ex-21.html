<div class="statement">Let $\base$ be a base for a topological space $X$. Show that if $f:X \to Y$ has the property that $f[B]$ is open for every $B \in \base$, then $f$ is an open function.</div>
<div class="proof">
	<p>Let $G$ be an open subset of $X$.</p>
	<p>Since $\base$ is a base for a topological space $X$, $G$ is union of members of $\base$. That is $G= \cup_i B_i$ where $B_i \in \base$</p>
	$$f[G] = f\sbracket{\cup_i B_i} = \cup_i f[B_i], \text{, where } B_i \in \base$$
	<p>Since $f[B]$ is open for every $B \in \base$, each $f[B_i]$ is open.</p>
	<p>Thus $f[G]$ is union of open sets and hence $f[G]$ is open. </p>
	<p>Therefore $f$ is open. </p>
