<div class="statement">Give an example of a real function  such that $f$ is continuous and closed, but not open.</div>
<div class="proof">
	<p>Let $H$ be an open subset of $\R$.</p>
	Since $f(x) = 1$ for all $x \in \R$, 
	$$ f^{-1}[H] = \begin{cases}
		\R &\mbox{ if } 1 \in H \\
		\emptyset &\mbox{ if } 1 \notin H
	\end{cases}$$
	<p>since $\R$ and $\emptyset$ are open, $f^{-1}[H]$ is open.</p>
	<p>Thus $f$ is continuous.</p>
	<hr>
	
	<p>Let $f:\R \to \R$ be defined by $f(x) = 1$. </p>
	<p>Since $f[A] = \{1\}$ for any $A \subset \R$, $A \ne \emptyset$.</p>
	<p>Hence $f[A]$ is closed for any closed set $A$. Thus $f$ is closed. </p>
	<p>Suppose $A$ be a nonempty open set. Then $f[A]=\{1\}$ is not open. Hence $f$ is not open. </p>
