<div class="statement">Prove: Let the functions $f: X \to Y$ and $g:Y \to Z$ be continuous. Then the composition function $g \composite f: X \to Z$ is also continuous.</div>
<div class="proof">
	<p>Let $H$ be an open subset of $Z$.</p>
	<p>Since $g:Y \to Z$ is continuous, $g^{-1}[H]$ is an open subset of $Y$. </p>
	<p>Since $f:X \to Y$ is continuous, $f^{-1}[g^{-1}[H]]$ is an open subset of $X$. </p>
	<p>Since $(g \composite f)^{-1}[H] = f^{-1}[g^{-1}[H]]$, $(g \composite f)^{-1}[H]$ is an open subset of $X$. </p>
	<p>Thus the composition function $g \composite f: X \to Z$ is also continuous.</p>
