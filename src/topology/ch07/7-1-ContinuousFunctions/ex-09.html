<div class="statement">Prove: Let $\{\Tau_i\}$ be a collection of topologies on a set $X$. If a function $f:X \to Y$ is continuous with respect to each $\Tau_i$, then $f$ is continuous with respect to the intersection topology $\Tau = \cap_i \Tau_i$</div>
<div class="proof">
	<p>Let $H$ be an open subset of $Y$.</p>
	<p>a function $f$ is continuous with respect to each $\Tau_i$, $f^{-1}[H]$ belong to each $\Tau_i$ and hence $f^{-1}[H] \in \cap_i \Tau_i$.</p>
	<p>Thus $f$ is continuous with respect to $\cap_i \Tau_i$.</p>
