<div class="statement">Prove Theorem 7.4: A function $f:X \to Y$ is continuous if and only if, for every subset $A \subset X$, $f[\closure{A}] \subset \closure{f[A]}$.</div>
<div class="proof">
	<p>Suppose $f:X \to Y$ is continuous. </p>
	<p>Let $A$ be any subset of of $X$.</p>
	\begin{align}
		\text{We have } f[A] &\subset \closure{f[A]} \\
		f^{-1}\sbracket{f[A]} &\subset f^{-1}\sbracket{\closure{f[A]}} \\
		A &\subset f^{-1}\sbracket{\closure{f[A]}} \\
		\closure{A} &\subset \closure{
			\inverse{f}{\closure{f[A]}}
		} \\
	\end{align}
	<p>Since $\closure{f[A]}$ is closed and $f$ is continuous, $\inverse{f}{\closure{f[A]}}$ is closed.</p>
	\begin{align}
		\closure{
			\inverse{f}{\closure{f[A]}}
		} &= \inverse{f}{\closure{f[A]}} \\
		\closure{A} &\subset \inverse{f}{\closure{f[A]}}\\
		f\left[\closure{A}\right] &\subset \closure{f[A]}\\
	\end{align}

	<hr />

	<p>Now suppose for every subset $A \subset X$, $f\sbracket{\closure{A}} \subset \closure{f[A]}$</p>
	<p>Let $F$ be a closed subset of $Y$.</p>
	<p>Put $\inverse{f}{F} = A$. We need to prove $A$ is closed, i.e. $\closure{A} = A$. </p>
	<p>Clearly $A = \inverse{f}{F}$ is a subset of $X$. Since $f[\closure{A}] \subset \closure{f[A]}$ for every subset $A \subset X$,</p>
		$$f[\closure{A}] \subset \closure{f[A]} = \closure{F} $$
	<p>Since $F$ is closed, $\closure{F} = F$.</p>
	\begin{align}
		f[\closure{A}] &\subset \closure{F} = F \\
		\inverse{f}{f[\closure{A}]} &\subset \inverse{f}{F} \\
		\closure{A} &\subset A
	\end{align}

	<p>By the definition of closure, we have $A \subset \closure{A}$.</p>
	<p>Thus $A = \closure{A}$ and $A = \inverse{f}{F}$ is closed. Therefore $f$ is continuous.</p>
