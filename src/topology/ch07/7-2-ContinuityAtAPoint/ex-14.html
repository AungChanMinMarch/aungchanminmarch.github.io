<div class="statement">Consider the following topology defined on $X = \{a,b,c,d\}$:
	$$\Tau = \{ X, \emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}, \{b,c,d\} \}$$
Let the function $f:X \to X$ be defined by the adjoining diagram.

<div class="proof">
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>$f(c) = b$. The open sets containing $f(c) = b$ are $X$, $\{b\}$, $\{a, b\}$ and $\{b,c,d \}$.</p>
			<p>$\{b \}$ is an open set containing $f(c)$ but $\inverse{f}{\{ b\}} = \{a, c\}$</p>
			<p>The open sets containing $c$ are $X$ and $\{b,c,d\}$.</p>
			<p>Thus there is no open sets containing $c$ which is contained in $\{a,c\}$. </p>
			<p>Thus $f$ is not continuous at $c$.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<p>$f(d) = c$. The open sets containing $f(d) = c$ are $X$ and $\{b,c,d\}$.</p>
			\begin{align}
				\inverse{f}{X} &= \{a,c,d,b\} = X \\
				\inverse{f}{\{b,c,d\}} &= \{a,c,d,b\} = X \\
			\end{align}
			<p>$\{b,c,d\}$ is an open set containing $d$ and $\{b,c,d\}$ is a superset of $X$. </p>
			<p>Thus $f$ is continuous at $d$.</p>
