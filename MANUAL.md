# definition 
use an html element with class name defintion
inside that element, use h2 for title and use p for body
e.g. <div class="definition">
	<h2>Pointwise Convergenet</h2>
	<p>Suppose $\{f_n\}, n=1,2,3...$ is a sequence of functions defined on a set $E$ and suppose that the sequence of numbers $\{f_n(x)\}$ converges for every $x\in E$. We can then define a function $f$ by $$f(x)=\lim_{n \to \inf}f_n(x) \ \ \ (x \in E)$$...</p>
</div>
